# CycleQuest: A Tour through Pittsburgh Crime Data

- Implemented a solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) by utilizing Prim's Minimum Spanning Trees algorithm

- Created a Java-based program that allows the user to input two dates and calculates an approximate TSP tour visiting crime locations from those dates

- Incorporated heaps and graphs in the implementation of the solution

- Achieved an optimal TSP solution through a brute-force method that analyzed all possible vertex permutations

- Presented the TSP solution output in an interactive format using Google Earth
