# CycleQuest: A Tour through Pittsburgh Crime Data

This project was the fourth among the 5 unique projects of the '95-771 - Data Structure and Algorithms for Information Processing' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Prof. Mike McCarthy, a renowned genius mind in this field, taught the course.

- Implemented a solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) by utilizing Prim's Minimum Spanning Trees algorithm

- Created a Java-based program that allows the user to input two dates and calculates an approximate TSP tour visiting crime locations from those dates

- Incorporated heaps and graphs in the implementation of the solution

- Achieved an optimal TSP solution through a brute-force method that analyzed all possible vertex permutations

- Presented the TSP solution output in an interactive format using Google Earth
